# Titanic Machine Learning (Random Forest)
Classic dataset used for learning more about R and modeling in R.  This dataset has been done to death, so it was for pure learning purposes.  For this reason, I did not do as much data visualization with this dataset.  I spent the majority of my time playing with the World of Warcraft (WoW) dataset.
